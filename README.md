# xState Presentation

## What is xState?

xState is a library for creating, interpreting, and executing finite state machines and statecharts, as well as managing invocations of those machines as actors.

## What is a Finite State Machine?

A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

## What is a Statechart?

A statechart is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems. Statecharts are used to describe the possible states of an object, the transitions between those states, and the actions that result from a state change. Statecharts are used to model the behavior of complex systems, such as those found in software applications, hardware devices, and other systems.

## Install and run the project

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

To start the server:

```bash
 npx json-server server/db.json5
```

To start the application using expo:

```bash
 cd xStateDemo/
 npm install
 npm start
```

If you want to run the test you need to execute this command:

```bash
 cd xStateDemo/ 
 npm test
```
